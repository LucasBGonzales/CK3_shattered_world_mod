# CK3_shattered_world_mod
Shattered World Mod originally by Peritino. The counties weren't properly breaking apart on the duchy shatter, this fixed that.

I want to make the higher-tier shatters actually conform to dejure lands too... but that will probably be another 2-3 hours of fumbling through these scripts.
